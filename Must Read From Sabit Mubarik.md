# terraform-course||
These are all the course directories that I have worked upon in order to perform the essential resource creation, management, automation and other things that are necessary eventually destroying the resource that are created automated.

I have used the script written by the tutor in order to teach myself how to run the terraform commands like 
-> Terraform apply
-> Terraform init
-> Terraform plan
-> Terraform destroy
etc.

#How to use||
All the directories have seperate files and scripts to perform the configuration management and resource automation.
These are the basic steps that you can use to get things done.
1- Clone the repository
2- Download and install vagrant and VMBox
3- Install the required setups and softwares.
4- Clone into the desired directory to deploy infra.
5- Give in the keys.
6- Add the resource names like AMIs and the AWS Secret Access keys and AWS Secret Key ID
7- Enjoy deploying just like me.

#Personal-Note There were certain things that I was unable to convey to you lovely folks.

The best aspect about me in order to describe why I am the best candidate is that I am like Hot Iron, I can be moulded into any shape as per your workload requirements.

I need a platform and an environment to perform at my level best. Everyone starts from somewhere and Nakisa can be the best platform for a rocket like me to reach the skies of success in this field.

My Certifications show my dedication and my current learnings and trainings are driving me towards further endeavours of betterment in this field.

I would request you to bless me with the opportunity to work for you, with you, on you and myself.

Just set a timeframe for e and measure my progress and I will do beyond what I can do inorder to do the best in this field.

I am really looking forward for your positive feedback and response.

I really want to work in DevOps while being a part of Nakisa.

I Believe that these practice material would be a piece of cake for you MR.Waqas and MR. Rehan.

These are some of the efforts from my end.

Hope it will serve the purpose.

Sabit Mubarik
