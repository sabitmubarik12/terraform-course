# terraform-course
These are all the course directories that I have worked upon in order to perform the essential resource creation, management, automation and other things that are necessary eventually destroying the resource that are created automated.

I have used the script written by the tutor in order to teach myself how to run the terraform commands like 
-> Terraform apply
-> Terraform init
-> Terraform plan
-> Terraform destroy
etc.

#Personal-Note
There were certain things that I was unable to convey to you lovely folks.

The best aspect about me in order to describe why I am the best candidate is that I am like Hot Iron, I can be moulded into any shape as per your workload requirements. 

I need a platform and an environment to perform at my level best. Everyone starts from somewhere and Nakisa can be the best platform for a rocket like me to reach the skies of success in this field.

My Certifications show my dedication and my current learnings and trainings are driving me towards further endeavours of betterment in this field.

I would request you to bless me with the opportunity to work for you, with you, on you and myself.

Just set a timeframe for e and measure my progress and I will do beyond what I can do inorder to do the best in this field.

I am really looking forward for your positive feedback and response.

I really want to work in DevOps while being a part of Nakisa.
